task-count-burndown
=========================

Barry Mullan (2015)

## Overview

This app is an alternative to the standard iteration or release burndown which measures task hours. This app provides a burndown based on task count, which is useful for teams who choose not to estimate their tasks. 

To use it, install the app (from the deply folder) as a custom html app on a release or iteration filtered dashboard page.
